      <h2>This Week's Gourmet Recipe Is...</h2>
      <p>Have you seen those roast potatoes all over the internet that are crispy on the outside and absolutely fluffy on the inside. Well we have and we had to figure out how to make them. This recipe will be perfect along side roast chicken recipe from a few weeks ago.<br>

      Roast Potatoes:<br>

      Ingredients: <br>
      2 Pounds of Yukon Gold or Russett <br>
      2 Table Spoons Baking Sode<br>
      Good Quality High Heat Oil (We used Avocado Oil)<br>
      Salt<br>
      Seasonings of Your Choice. (We used garlic and rosemary)<br>
      <br>

      Directions: <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees</li>
        <li>Peel the potatoes and dice them into 2 inch chunks</li>

      "The homemade soft pretzel bites made with sourdough discard were the perfect addition to our family movie night. I used the previous recipe from the quick snacks page to make cheese dipping sauce for them. I will be making these again because they tasted delicious and were also the perfect way to use up some my sourdough discard." -Hannah P.  <br>

      "The slow roasted short ribs were the perfect meal to make for my boyfriends birthday dinner. He couldn't believe that I had made them myself. They pair perfectly with the suggested mashed potatoes and roasted carrots. I will absolutely be making these again for special occasion meals." - Tina C. <br>

      "The chopped cobb salad with homemade lemon shallot dressing made me feel like I was out to lunch on vacation. All the ingredients combined perfectly. The chopping was a little tedious, but it was worth the effort. I will be making this salad all summer!" - Mary M.<br>
