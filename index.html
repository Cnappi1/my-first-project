      <p><strong>New Game Night Idea: </strong><br>
        Everyone, pick a game that they want to play!<br>
        All the selections get written down and put into a hat or bowl. <br>
      Take turns drawing games out of the hat. The last game remaining is the one that you play! <br>
      Next game night, the one that was chosen to be played is left out of the hat! This way, everyone's favorite game gets a chance to be played! <br>
      <br>

      <h3>Elevate Your Space</h3>
      <p><Strong>We get it.</Strong> <br>
      We all wish that we could afford to completely redecorate our homes with every new trend and style being released. This is not the case for the majority of us. Below are a few affordable ways to spruce up your space without breaking the bank! <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Buy new covers for your throw pillows! The decorative pillow can be expensive, especially when you want to change the color or style every few months. Measuring your pillows and finding a more affordable pillow case can give you the new feeling you are looking for without having to buy entirely new pillows to change up your space.</li>
        <li>Switching out the candles or wax melts that you have is another way to make your space feel different and fresh! We know this seems silly, BUT our sense of smell can elevate our mood and how we feel about our surroundings. Think we are <strong>CRAZY?</strong> How would you feel if you walked into your living room and it smelled like old tuna cans....Gross right? That would deflate your mood in no time at all. So imagine walking into your house and it smell like fresh-baked bread or flowers when previously it smelled like lemons and clean laundry. It is a <strong>COMPLETE</strong> vibe changer!</a></li>
      </ul>
      <Strong>Come back next week for more tips on how to ELEVATE your space!</Strong>
