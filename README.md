# my-first-project
This is my Spring 2025 project for CS2100: Intro to Web Development. 
My website, Happy At Home, is designed to create community and provide information on how to live your happiest life at home.
This includes tips on elevating your space, recipes, games, movie reviews, and more!

Key Aspects of the Site:
Home Page: Welcoming users. It offers a featured item, game, or idea for the week. It also offers you tips on how to elevate your home.
About Us: Get to know the people at Happy At Home. What our story is and meet an employee of the month.
Recipes: Try some of our recipes. There is a range from beginner to gourmet.
Entertainment: Check out recommendations for movies, TV shows, books, crafts, and more!
Store: Arriving soon! A store to meet all your cozy needs, from homewares to comfy sweatshirts.
