      "The Pink Carnation Book series has been so much fun! It combines my love of history, romance, humor, and a little bit of suspense. I also love how many books are in the series. I always hate letting go of characters I love. This lets me hang out with them for a little longer. -Michelle M.<br>

      Just like everyone at "Happy At Home" I am a big fan of author Lucy Foley. Their recent read and recommendation of The Paris Apartment was one of my favorites so far. This was one where I couldn't decide whose side I was on or exactly what had happened until the last couple of chapters. I love it when a book keeps me guessing until the very last page. Can't wait for the next book review release! - Cindy W. <br>
