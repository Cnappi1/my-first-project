      <h2>This Week's Beginner Friendly Meal Is...</h2>
      <p>Have you ever been craving the cheesy melty layers of a lasgana, but you just don't have the time, energy or desire to create it from scratch? Well do we have an easy and delcious recipe for you!<br>
      This week's recipe is a ravioli bake.<br>

      Lazy Lasagna:<br>

      Ingredients: <br>
      25 Oz Frozen Ravioli <br>
      24 OZ Jar of Your Favorite Pasta Sauce <br>
      2 cups shredded mozarella cheese<br>
      1/3 cup grated parmesan<br>
      <br>

      Directions: <br>
      <ul>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees</li>
        <li>Grease 9x13 baking dish</li>
        <li>Spread 3/4 cup of sauce onto the bottom of your dish. (This keeps your pasta from sticking to the bottom and burning)</li>
        <li>Arange half the the ravioli in a single layer on top of the sauce</li>
        <li>Cover the ravioli with half the remaining sauce and half of the mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Use the rest of your ravioli to form another single layer, then the rest of your sauce and finally the rest of your mozzarella cheese and the parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Cover with foil and bake for 30 minutes. Remove the foil after 30 minutes and bake for another 15. This will let your cheese fishin melting. </li>
        <li>Cool for 10 minutes then <strong>ENJOY!</strong> </li>
      </ul>
