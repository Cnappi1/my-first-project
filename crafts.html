      <h2>Craft Tips of the Week. </h2>
       <p>
       <ul>
        <li>Pick one craft at time. It is so easy to get caught up in the exciting world and vast options of the craft world. This can also cause you to become overwhelmed with lots of unfinished projects and a struggling bank account. The key is to find the craft you are wanting to try the most and see it through. This will give you the satisfaction of having an end result you love that had your full attention.</li>
        <li>You are not a professional. You crafts may not turn out as great as the examples provided by the person posting the directions for your craft. That doesn't mean what you created is any less special or worthy of feeling accomplished for creating it. Did you have fun making it? That is all that matters. One of the main points of crafting or creating art is to enjoy yourself not just the item you are creating.</li>
