      <h2>How We Got Here And Why.</h2>
      <p>In March of 2020, the entire world shut down, leaving many of us stuck at home for the first time. On a day-to-day basis, many of us were used to being able to leave the house whenever we wanted. During 2020, this was not the case. We were at home trying to figure out what to do with ourselves while also coping with what was going on around us. If you were anything like the Happy At Home team, you found yourself feeling lost. We realized that we didn't know how to be happy in our home with all the fantastic things around us. This lead to an idea that we need to learn to appreciate the things we already have and stop always looking for adventure outside our homes. We can find joy and adventure right where we live. Whether it be through a new movie, recipe, book, or a million other things. Happy At Home strives to show users that you can be your happiest and most content self in your home if you know where to look! Join our community of loving where your live and get some great suggestions on how to maximize fun and comfort at home! We are so happy to have you! </p>

      <p>Carly is our mastermind behind Happy At Home. She was completely guilty of having a "To Be Read List" a mile long and recipes to be tried stacked to the ceiling. Carly believes that finding joy at home is something we all need to strive to find because we in her own words "We sure do pay a ton of money for a house we are never at!" As Happy At Home grow so will our team! Always check back to see who we are showcasing!
