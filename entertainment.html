      <h2>How about a quick game?</h2>
      <p>
      We are just really feeling nostalgic lately because this week's card game is a favorite from many people's childhoods. <br>
      We have been playing the card game Crazy Eights again! <br>
      For those of you who haven't had the pleasure of playing this game before, we have included the instructions below! <br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>All you need is a standard deck of cards.</li>
        <li>Shuffle your deck of cards. Deal 5 cards to each player. If only 2 people are playing, you will deal 7 cards to each player.</li>
        <li>Place the remaining cards face down to form a draw pile, and flip the top card over to start the discard pile.</li>
        <li>Each player takes turns playing a card from their hand that matches the rank or suit of the top card on the discard pile. If a player cannot play a card, they must draw from the draw pile. Eights are wild and can be played at any time, allowing the player to change the current suit.</li>
        <li>The goal is to be the first player to get rid of all your cards.</li>
      </ul>

      <strong>What was your favorite card game growing up? Were you a Crazy Eights fan like us? Or was it something else? Let us know!</strong>
