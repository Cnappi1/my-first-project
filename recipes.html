      <h2>Quick Cooking Tips! </h2>
      <p>
       <ul>
        <li>The first tip comes from Rachel Ray way back in the day when Carly used to watch her cooking shows with her dad. Rachel told us to keep a "trash bowl" on the counter while you cook. This is honestly a game changer. You throw all your scraps, wraps, and peels into this bowl as you cook. Then when you are done you dump the content of the bowl in the trash. This might seem like a wasteful dirting of a dish, but it really is nice to not be going back and for to the trash can constantly. Your trash bowl is right there waiting for you on the counter as you go. </li>
        <li>Prep all your items before you go. This goes beyond just chopping vegetables and seasoning your meat. Go ahead and measure out all your ingredients when necessary. Go ahead and get out all the utensils, dishes, and pans you need to cook your meal. Prepping ahead of time greats a better flow while cooking which will make the experience much more enjoyable.</li>
